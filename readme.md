# ESDBank
An web application that aims to mimic a bank online service. It caters to three scenarios:
1. Payment transfers between different users of the app
2. Splitting share bills between users 
3. An AI powered chatbot to provide advice on users' spending

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python modules by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

To run each microservice locally:

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory of each microservice.

Run the Python script for each microservice.

Once all microservices are running, you can access the application at http://localhost:4999/login.

Then login to jakoblwr@gmail.com , and wait for it to initalize.
